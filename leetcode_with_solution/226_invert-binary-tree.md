Trivia:
This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:

###Solution
```java

public class Solution {
    public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null)
            return root;
        
        TreeNode l = root.left;
        TreeNode r = root.right;
        
        root.left = invertTree(r);
        root.right = invertTree(l);
        
        return root;
    }
