 Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.
Example:

nums = [1, 2, 3]
target = 4

The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)

Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

Therefore the output is 7 Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.Example:
